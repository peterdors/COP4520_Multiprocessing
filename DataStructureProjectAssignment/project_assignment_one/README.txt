This will hold the sequential implementations and multithreaded w/ MRLock implementations of our Linked List data structure.

The Linked List inserts node in sorted orderings, thus giving us a sorted list. 

Our algorithm is based on the Lazy Synchronization locking technique for multithreaded lists.
