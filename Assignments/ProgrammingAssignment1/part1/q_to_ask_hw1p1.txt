Would using the vector<bool> and initializing it all to true before doing the 
sieve be an allowed way of doing so? 

Would the threads have to produce the list of the 10 maximum primes or can we do
that outside of/when the threading is complete? 

Looking for ways to make threading faster as I am currently at 5 second runtime 
on 8 threads for 1e8 numbers.
